## Solve

This challenge is the same as *Hammering out* and the only difference is the seed used. Some participants mentioned that it was a honeypot... well it's true the honeypot is relevant because the seed is the name in the GIF honeypot, *Hero Hunny*. "Guessy" challenge? It's a CTF, not real life.

Whine the who? Ups sorry, Winnie the who.
